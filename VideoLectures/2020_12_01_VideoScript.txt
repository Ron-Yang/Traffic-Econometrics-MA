===========================

Hello dear students and
general public. In this video,
I want to show how my covid-19
simulator at
corona-simulation.de can be
used to investigate several
scenarios for the pandemics
this winter.

Along with it, I want to
present the methods and the
thinking of an econometrist.


Start the simulation
=====================

[auf Covid-19 Logo druecken]
[dann ENGLISCH FLAG druecken]

Now let's just start the default
setting activated when
loading corona-simulation.de:
Germany, till present, data
as of 30th of November 2020

* Updated daily if data become
  available
* Red: Cases per day data
* Black: Deaths per day data
* Black curve upper: simulated
  cases/day
* Gray curve lower graph:
  simulated deaths/day

* Gray numbers below: Base
  reproduction number R0 with
  100% susceptibles,
  no immunity by contamination
  or vaccination

* at present:
  Base reproduction number
  R0=1.10,
  actual contamination
  around 11%,
  actual R number around
  R=1.00 => stagnation

* The base number reflects
  the covid-19 measures,
  but also the season
  winter/summer and how pople
  generally behave in the
  respective country

* The actual number reflects
  the dynamics in 1-2 weeks.
  It is lower than R0 because
  of assumed immunity of the
  already infected

* R0 and R based only
  indirectly on the data:
  via the model R's fitted
  to the data.
  This is the basis for the
  powerful future projection
  possibilities because,
  obviously, no data are
  available in the future

  
Now let's identify some
game changers:

* Starts exponential increase
  February/March: R above 2
* [senkr Strich bis Datum]
  Measures Mid March 
* [arrow at R=0.9]
 exp increase for 1-2 more weeks
  but R already near/below 1
* ["S"] Summer: Decay in spite
  of relaxing measures: Summer
* ["W"] Autumn/Winter:
  increasing infections
* [senkr Strich bis Datum]
  New measures in Germany
* With the usual delay of
  1-2 weeks stagnation

2. Scenario Projections
#######################

Scenario Projection
=conditional forecast
assuming certain measures.

Scenario 1:
Permanent semi-lockdown
============================

Remember the R0 parameter?
The simulation says that is now (semi-lockdown, winter) 1.12.
However, this is the base
reproduction number
for 100% susceptible persons.

In fact, 10% have already been
infected [point to that],
so the actual R is given by
1.00, i.e., stagnation.

If I want to maintain the
present measures (semi-lockdown)
permanently, what will happen?
Just press go once the
simulation has stopped at the
present

[Go -> Mar 2021 then R0 down]
[horiz+vertical line where
cases=6000 
-> 40 000 per week,
or 50 per 100 000]

Now let's do the body count

[Cumulated cases]

You will have a total of 30 000
covid-19 deaths, and about 20 000 this winter season.
As many as in a stronger flu
season as 2017/18


[ point at contamination]
Furthermore, more than 20% are
already infected INCLUDING THE
UNREPORTED CASES yielding
no perfect immunity (for this
we need about 60%) but a
significant stabilisation
and complete decay in summer,
even w/o measures



Scenario 2: Happy Christmas
===========================

As scenario 1 (partial lockdown)
but only general distance
rules over Christmas

[4 weeks w/o changes]

[R0=1.3 for 2 Christmas weeks]

[R0 back to last calibr value
1.12 till March]

[Reduction due to spring/summer
sun and temps afterwrds]

Body Count: Nearly no
change compared to permanent
semi-lockdown!


Scenario 3:
Hard wave breaker
==================

Complete hard lockdown
till Christmas,
then normal distance rules


Assume that in a complete
lockdown in winter, the R0
number drops by 30 percentage
points to 0.8 till
christmas.

[simulate R0=0.8 to Dec20]

Observe after a
delay a strong breakdown,
after 14-21 days also for the
casualties [black curve].

Are we done with it? You cannot
maintain strikt or semi
lockdown for 
a longer period, so relax
for Christmas to the normal
distance and mask rules
w/o lockdown, 
say R0=1.3 instead of 1.1 till
end of March,

[simulate R0=1.3 till March]

then, w/o changing
anything, spring summer will
lead to lower R0 values and
the wave is gone. Now,
do the body count:

[switc cumulative cases]

Even a bit more casualties,
about 35 000 total,
25 000 this season  


Scenario 4:
Laisser faire at/after Christmas
===============================

Only distance/mask rules
thereafter

[4 weeks w/o changes]
[R0=1.3 afterwards]

Body Count about 50 000
instead of 35 000,
or 40 000 for this winter
season. This is a very strong
flu but not unheard-of


Scenario 5: Other countries
============================

Austria: peak Nov 13 @ Xtot=18%,
  Ract=0.89 @ 24%
Tschechia: peak Oct 23 @ 20%,
  Ract=0.76 @ 35%
Spain: peak Nov 2 @ ,
  Ract=0.85 @ 27%
Sweden: peak not reached,
  Ract=1.00 @ 17%
Switzerland: peak Nov 2 @ 17%,
  Ract 0.80 @ 28%
Russia: peak not reached,
  Ract=1.06 @ 11%

USA: peak not reached @ 30%
  only exception

India: Reduction although
  smaller contamination
  Google: new delhi weather

Australia, Peru/Chile,
South Africa: Peak in summer



3. Other presentation windows
#############################

[cumulated cases]
=================

We already used that to look
up the body count

[Simulation (log)]
===================

* This is mainly for viewing the
  active cases (orange) and
  total simulated infections

* Distance between red and blue
  line: Unreported (about factor
  of 8, shrinking

[cases vs infected]
===================

The effect of the test numbers:
At the beginning, orange curve
of simulated new infections
at the red bars of
observed cases (=>factor 10).

Now, the unreported factor
lower => red bars above orange
curve 

[test window]
=============

Blue test numbers increasing,
then decreasing/strongly
fluctuating

Green false positive cases now
much smaller than the true
positives, not so in summer 

[infection rates]
================


Observed
Case fatality rate (CFR)

Simulated
Infection Fatality Rate 0.2%

Final disclaimer.
These are conditional
projections, not 
unconditional forecasts,
although there is much
simulation evidence
that Czech and Swizzerland
are done with the pandemic,
in contrast to Germany.

This video is published on the First of December. Lets see if
it stands the test of time.
